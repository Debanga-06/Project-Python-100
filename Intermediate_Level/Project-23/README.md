# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Tic Tac Toe game** implemented in Python where:
- The player uses **X**.
- The AI uses **O** and plays optimally using the **Minimax algorithm**.

The game runs in the terminal and allows a human player to compete against an unbeatable AI.

## ✨ Features
- **Interactive Gameplay** → Play Tic Tac Toe directly in the terminal.  
- **AI Opponent** → Uses the Minimax algorithm to always make the best possible move.  
- **Winner Detection** → Automatically checks for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals).  
- **Draw Handling** → Declares a draw if no moves are left.  
- **Simple & Beginner-Friendly** → Easy to understand and extend for learning purposes.

## 💻 Supported Platforms
- **Windows**  
- **Linux**  
- **macOS**  

👉 Works on any platform with Python 3 installed.

## 📦 Requirements
No external libraries are required.  
This project uses only Python’s built-in modules (`math`).

---

## ▶️ Usage
Run the game from the terminal:
```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

Gameplay:
1. You are **X**, AI is **O**.  
2. Enter a position (0–8) to place your move.  
   - Positions are numbered left to right, top to bottom.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     0 | 1 | 2
     --+---+--
     3 | 4 | 5
     --+---+--
     6 | 7 | 8
     ```
3. The AI will respond with its move.  
4. The game continues until there is a winner or a draw.
